### Description

I took parts of a few source codes I found on this site and combined them and improved them to make a more complete ICQ Clone. The following three pages are where I took code from(that I remember). I made this like 9 to 10 months ago. As you might notice the code has been changed a lot from the originals. I hope this helps people. http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.6520/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.2039/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm http://www.planet-source-code.com/xq/ASP/txtCodeId.10397/lngWId.1/qx/vb/scripts/ShowCode.htm I've included a text file with code that might assist in improving the communication between the client and server or client to client transfers.
